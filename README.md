Telco Customer ChurnRate Analysis
This project was built by Shuheng. Ma, Yikang. Wang, Yiqun. Tian, Li. Zhou.

We will describe how we built basic but useful models to explain the churn rate based on the Kaggle Telco Customer dataset. 
The specific process includes 
(1) Background and Problem
(2) Data Summary and Exploratory Analysis
(3) Data Analyses
(4) Strategy Recommendations, Limitations, and Future Research
